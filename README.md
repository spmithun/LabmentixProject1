# LabmentixProject1 : Uber Supply-Demand Gap Analysis 🚖📊

## 📌 Introduction

This project explores the supply-demand gap in Uber ride requests using real-world data. The objective is to analyze operational inefficiencies, identify unfulfilled demands, and suggest improvements to optimize driver allocation and customer satisfaction. The analysis is conducted using Python, SQL, and Excel.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

* Identify peak demand periods and supply shortages.
* Compare trip statuses across different time slots and pickup points.
* Analyze driver behavior, cancellation trends, and trip durations.
* Provide actionable business insights for Uber to improve operational efficiency.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

* **Languages**: Python, SQL
* **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Other Tools**: Excel, Jupyter Notebook, MySQL Workbench

## 📈 Key Outcomes

* Found significant unmet demand during Night and Morning rush hours.
* City pickup points suffer from high cancellation rates.
* Airport pickup points suffer from high car unavaialability rates.
* Driver-specific insights uncovered high-performing vs low-performing drivers.
* Suggested time-slot-specific and location-specific strategies for resource reallocation.

## 💡 Recommendations

* Reallocate drivers during peak hours in the City.
* Reduce city-based cancellations by addressing urban driver friction.
* Incentivize high-performing drivers and optimize fleet deployment.
