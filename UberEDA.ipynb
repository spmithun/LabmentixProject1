        "This project centers on the analysis of Uber ride request data with the goal of identifying and understanding the supply-demand gap that frequently leads to failed ride requests, particularly through cancellations and “No Cars Available” scenarios. The approach adopted was methodologically layered and tool-specific, with an emphasis on using Excel, SQL, and Python (Pandas and visualization libraries) to carry out various stages of the data analysis pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process began with data cleaning and preparation using Excel, which involved multiple steps to make the dataset analysis-ready. First, inconsistent date-time formats in the Request timestamp and Drop timestamp columns were converted to a standard format, allowing temporal analysis. Missing values—especially in the Driver id and Drop timestamp fields—were flagged and interpreted in the context of trip status. Unassigned drivers were treated as indicators of failed request attempts. Duplicate records were removed, and derived columns such as hour-of-day and trip duration were added to support downstream analysis. Once cleaned, the dataset was formatted into structured tables for visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following Excel, we shifted to SQL-based exploration, which involved writing queries to extract specific insights from the cleaned dataset. These queries focused on summarizing ride statuses by pickup point, computing failure percentages, analyzing driver participation patterns, and isolating time blocks with maximum unfulfilled requests. SQL was particularly effective in aggregating trip outcomes hour-wise and computing the proportion of completed trips versus failures. We also used SQL to compare the request-to-completion ratio across the City and Airport pickup zones.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final and most detailed layer of analysis was carried out using Python, primarily with Pandas for data wrangling and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations. The dataset was grouped and filtered extensively to perform complex Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Key operations included generating time-series plots to observe request volume across the day, computing trip durations and mapping them against status, and constructing stacked bar graphs to visualize status breakdowns by hour and location. A heatmap was created to capture request density across hour-of-day and pickup point combinations. We also analyzed the distribution of trip outcomes across weekdays and weekends, with special focus on high-demand slots.\n",
        "\n",
        "This multi-tool process not only ensured a robust analysis from multiple angles but also enabled cross-validation of findings across tools, increasing confidence in the conclusions drawn.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key insight was the identification of shift change hours—around 2 PM and 10 PM—as high-risk windows for trip failure. During these times, a clear drop in driver engagement led to increased cancellations or lack of driver assignment. Additionally, Airport pickups during early morning hours (5–9 AM) often suffered from lack of available cars despite high demand, and City pickups in the evening (5–9 PM) experienced frequent cancellations by drivers, likely due to traffic or trip preference.\n",
        "\n",
        "These findings underscore the importance of dynamic scheduling, better shift planning, and incentive-driven driver alignment. The analysis presents actionable recommendations for Uber to minimize failures, optimize supply, and enhance the rider experience."

A missing value in this column indicates that no driver was assigned, typically corresponding to a “No Cars Available” outcome.

This helps test whether trip length influences cancellations at different pickup points. The layout is clear and makes it easy to compare trends side by side. Such a chart is valuable for spotting operational inefficiencies linked to trip patterns."

Proactive strategies will convert these insights into positive impact."

City pickups suffer from high cancellation rates, while Airport pickups face frequent unavailability. Specific drivers contribute disproportionately to cancellations, suggesting the need for targeted training and resource reallocation. Long trips do not directly reduce cancellation risks, especially in urban areas. Addressing time-slot and location-specific issues, improving driver performance, and incentivizing high-demand coverage can enhance service reliability. Implementing these insights will help the client boost customer satisfaction, optimize fleet efficiency, and drive sustainable business growth."
